  \item If $log_2 \, 3 = x$, then the value of $log_8 \, 12$ is\ldots\\
        (Logarithm, Grade 10)

  \item $f(x) = 4x^2 + 3x + 8$ [$A$] \\
        $g(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ [$B$] \\
        Function $A$ has the same form as function $B$. Calculate $9a+8b+7c$. \\

  \item In 2019, a steam wallet filling service is doing business.

        The cheapest wallet filling is IDR $45\,000$, and he offers IDR $50\,000$ for each filling. Meanwhile, the most expensive wallet filling is IDR $900\,000$, and he offers IDR $905\,000$ for each filling.

        The capital he prepared was IDR $5\,500\,000$ for doing business. If $x$ represents the number of fillings for the cheapest wallet and $y$ represents the most expensive wallet filling, then the most appropriate target function for the fish trader to get the maximum profit is\ldots \\

  \item In a free gacha event, there is Box 1 containing $2$ Oshi A stickers and $4$ Oshi B stickers. Meanwhile, Box 2 contains $5$ Oshi A stickers and $3$ Oshi B stickers. 1 sticker is taken from each box. The probability of getting an Oshi A sticker from Box 1 and an Oshi B sticker from Box 2 is... \\
        (Probability, Grade 12)

  \item The $2^{nd}$ and $5^{th}$ terms of a geometric sequence are $1$ and $8$, respectively. Find the value of the $11^{th}$ term! \\
        (Geometric Sequence, Grade 12)

  \item Find the (first) derivative of the functions below:
